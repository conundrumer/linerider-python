Line Rider Python
================

Line Rider originally created by Bostjan Cadez (fsk)

Continuous collision detection adapted from [line circle collision tutorial](http://ericleong.me/research/circle-line)

Verlet integration and constraints adapted from [advanced character physics](http://www.gpgstudy.com/gpgiki/GDC 2001%3A Advanced Character Physics)

This was my final project to 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming at CMU. This was also the first time I worked on a major programming project, so obviously it's not the cleanest nor the most efficient code. In addition, it was until the next year that I learned about version control.
