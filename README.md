Continuous collision detection adapted from [line circle collision tutorial](www.t3hprogrammer.com/research/line-circle-collision/tutorial)

Verlet integration and constraints adapted from [advanced character physics](www.gpgstudy.com/gpgiki/GDC 2001%3A Advanced Character Physics)

This was my final project to 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming at CMU. This was also the first time I worked on a major programming project, so obviously it's not the cleanest nor the most efficient code. In addition, it was until the next year that I learned about version control.
